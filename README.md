# Wi-Fi Password Strength Visualizer 🔐📶

## 📝 Problem Statement
Many users set weak or predictable Wi-Fi passwords without realizing their networks are vulnerable to attacks like brute-force or dictionary-based cracking. This tool helps users visualize the strength of their Wi-Fi password and understand how secure or insecure it really is.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to help users understand whether their Wi-Fi password is secure or not. It gives you feedback, suggestions, crack time estimates, and also helps generate stronger passwords.

## 🚀 Features
- Visual gauge showing password entropy
- Strength label (Weak / Moderate / Strong)
- Time estimate for cracking the password
- Tips on how to improve it
- Option to show or hide password input
- Password generator built-in
- Pressing Enter also works to check strength

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- `tkinter` – for GUI  
- `matplotlib` – to draw the gauge  
- `secrets`, `math`, `re` – for logic and randomness

## 💻 How to Run it

1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

 2. Run the Application
```bash
python3 wifi_password_strength_visualizer.py
```

## 📚 Usage Instructions
1. Type a password
2. Click “Check Strength” or press Enter
3. See the strength, entropy, and crack time
4. Use “Generate Strong Password” for suggestions
